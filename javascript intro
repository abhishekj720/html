should write in last before closing of the body tag bec the function may not know about the buttons functionalities

var keyword
typeof  for getting the type of variable
var keyword is global
any variable that you create with keyword var that will be inside window object
any variable defined within function,will not be able to access outside.
window objects are common for all the files
document is part of window object

few selectors to locate object
1. document.getElementById()
2. document.getElementsByClassName()
3. document.getElementsByTagName

no class in javascript but there is object in javascript ,that is why it is called object based programming not obj. oriented programming.


guidelines
1. always recommended to start the first name of the file with "use strict" ----- will give errors of defining varibles of global
2. if u are using global variables then u (should) define in starting of the program.--ex- var a,b,c
